# Required logins

Before being able to contribute to the project, access to the following resources /domains are required:

## Accounts

The production domain provides access to the production cluster and email. Machines on this domain are locked down and a help desk request must be logged to install new software.

The format for user names is _<lastname><initial>@cwglobal.local_

**Non-prod account**: 

The non-prod domain provides access to the development/CI cluster, and the pre-prod cluster. Power user access should be available and software can be installed as required.   Typically space on the machines is limited and software should be installed on the D drive. 

The format for usernames is _npd<initial><lastname>@nonprod.local_
