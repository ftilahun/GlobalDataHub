# Open Design Proposals

## Purpose

Open Design Proposals are designed to be a documentation format like RFCs for the internet or PEPs for the Python language to define changes in the architecture of the project. Anyone on the project can be an author of a design proposal and anyone can edit a design proposal until it is agreed.

With Open Design Proposals we will gain the following :-

* Buy in for design changes - As anyone can edit these anyone can take part and are more likely to accept design decisions
* Documentation of design decisions in the context the decisions were taken - New people joining the project can see not just What decision was made but Why
* Peer review - Moving away from a central architecture model to a community driven model allows the pool of talent within the project to contribute to decisions Open Design Proposals are a way of "Open Sourcing" Our design.
